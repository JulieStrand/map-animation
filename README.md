## An animated map of bus stops in Cambridge, MA<br>
<img src="map animation.png"><br>
Click the button in the upper left corner of the map, and you will see a quick animation of markers on the map representing the bus stops for the MBTA #1 bus between the MIT and Harvard campuses in Cambridge, MA. The stop coordinates are stored in an array in the code and were obtained from the MBTA. This code can be used as a model for other geographic data animation or other animations drawing from an array.
